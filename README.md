# ProjectEuler
The problems for Project Euler I have solved (both Python and Haskell)

## Python
These are generally very straightforward to undertand / interpret, and make great use of the math library import

## Haskell
I am not very familiar with Haskell, so these will be a little more dense and inefficient until I'm more experienced
